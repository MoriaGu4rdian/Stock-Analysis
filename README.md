# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis was to get comfortable using Excel VBA as a tool to automate certain operations. This can help keep different analyses standardized and make it easy to add unified changes. 
## Results
The VBA exercise remained incredibly confusing, with certain errors not being apparent and regularly changing. Errors such as: 
![2018 VBA Debug](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86446572/125218683-6bb39a80-e291-11eb-8ae7-804ae8a67531.jpg)

appeared frequently, with the "Debug" feature regularly highlighting lines that had no obvious flaws.

Running the program would also sometimes highlight different lines of the code as issues after you restarted it, leading to confusion about what the actual issue was. I was unable to determine how to get the proper results of this exercise, with the following screenshot the only semblance of success (I was at least able to get the program to run, even if it showed the wrong answer):

## Summary
The primary advantage to refactoring code is obviously the speed of results, in addition to the succinct nature of the code. However, since the code is so compact, tiny flaws lead to massive flaws in the results; which might have been able to be dealt with individually with less succinct code. I think attempting to refactor made finding the issues with the code much more difficult since I'm not incredibly comfortable with the program and how more refined parts of the code broke down the analysis of the data.
